Having a plan is one of the most important factors when building a new project. This article will share 5 steps you should take before building a plan. 

### **Step 1: Check if the idea has been done before**
Before we do anything lets see if the project has been done before. A quick Google search should give us some information.

If the results show your project idea is patented then your road ends here.

### **Step 2: Check competition**
Unless you have a completely groundbreaking original idea you will normally have some sort of competition. This is a good and a bad thing. The good thing is you can learn from your competition and the bad thing is well now its a competition.

### **Step 3: Check supply and demand**
So you see the compititon now how are they doing? Are they flooded with business? Going out of business? Knowing the supply and demand will let you know if its worth moving forward. 

### **Step 4: Check resources and cost**
Now seeing the cometition and supply and demand you should have a price or value of your project. The price you should have in mind is the cost to start and maintain your project. Hosting, Domain, Programmers, etc I would contact a few experts in the field and get a quote. 

### **Step 5: Create the plan**
If you complete those steps and still decide your project is worth wild create the plan! Good luck.
